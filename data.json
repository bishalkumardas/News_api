the second week of FY26.", "image_link": "https://cdn.finshots.app/images/2024/11/Trump.jpg", "content": "The Indian stock market ended last week on a weak note, breaking a two-week winning streak, as global trade tensions flared up following steep tariff hikes by US President Donald Trump. The week saw sharp declines in both Sensex and Nifty 50, primarily driven by weak global cues and fears of a renewed trade war.\r\n\r\nIn the coming week, investors will closely watch several critical events that could influence market direction. These include the RBI’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting, the beginning of the Q4 earnings season with TCS results, macroeconomic data releases such as IIP and CPI inflation, and continued global developments including trade measures and geopolitical cues.\r\n\r\nHere's a look at the key triggers:\r\n\r\n<ul> <li><b>RBI MPC Meeting:</b> The central bank’s first policy decision for FY26 is due on April 9. Market participants anticipate a potential 25 bps rate cut, which could benefit rate-sensitive sectors.</li> <li><b>Q4 Results Season:</b> Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) will kick off the earnings season on April 10. Expectations remain muted amid weak global demand and margin pressures in the IT sector.</li> <li><b>Macroeconomic Indicators:</b> Key data releases include the <i>Index of Industrial Production (IIP)</i> and <i>Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation</i> for March. IIP will be released on April 11, while CPI may be out on April 15 due to a holiday.</li> <li><b>Global Trade and Tariffs:</b> Trump's imposition of steep tariffs, including a 27% levy on select Indian goods, has reignited fears of a global trade war, weighing on investor sentiment worldwide.</li> <li><b>FII Activity:</b> Foreign institutional investors pulled out nearly ₹13,730 crore from Indian equities last week. In contrast, domestic investors provided support with net inflows of around ₹5,632 crore.</li> </ul>\r\n<b>Market Outlook:</b>\r\nVolatility is expected to remain high, as reflected in the rise of the India VIX. Experts advise caution as uncertainties around global trade, inflation, and central bank policy decisions continue to influence investor behavior. Defensive sectors and safe-haven assets like gold and bonds are likely to see increased interest amid ongoing geopolitical and economic concerns.", "sentiment": "Negative"}}, {"model": "comment_api.news", "pk": 2, "fields": {"date": "2025-04-07", "head": "Indian Firms Plan $4.5 Billion in Bond Sales Amid Yield Decline", "sub_head": "Companies Take Advantage of Lower Yields to Front-Load Borrowing at Fiscal Year Start", "image_link": "https://images.goodreturns.in/img/2025/02/stock-market-crash600-1738906089.jpg", "content": "<p>\r\n  At the onset of India's new fiscal year, companies are making a rare move to borrow \r\n  <strong>$4.5 billion</strong> via bond sales within the first five trading days of April 2025.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  This surge is driven by a notable drop in yields—\r\n  <strong>25–30 basis points</strong> for AAA-rated short-term bonds and \r\n  <strong>20–25 basis points</strong> for long-term ones—prompting strong demand from investors.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  Non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) are leading the charge with shorter-term issues, \r\n  while some state-run entities are issuing longer-term bonds at yields possibly under \r\n  <strong>7%</strong>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  The borrowing spree follows liquidity-enhancing measures by the \r\n  <strong>Reserve Bank of India (RBI)</strong>, including \r\n  <strong>₹5.2 trillion</strong> in financial injections through debt purchases and forex swaps.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n  With expectations of further rate cuts and stock market uncertainty, companies and investors \r\n  alike are seizing this window of opportunity.\r\n</p>", "sentiment": "Negative"}}, {"model": "comment_api.news", "pk": 3, "fields": {"date": "2025-04-08", "head": "India Maintains Growth Outlook Despite 26% U.S. Tariff on Imports", "sub_head": "Government stays firm on 6.3%–6.8% GDP projection as economists raise concerns", "image_link": "https://media.istockphoto.com/id/1858820017/photo/india-united-states-trade.jpg?s=2048x2048&w=is&k=20&c=viOkKfA4UUAHvY4E_WXykfZ6TMNep7gOZyEN3BSbgTc=", "content": "<p>The Indian government remains confident about its economic growth, projecting a GDP increase of <strong>6.3% to 6.8%</strong> for the fiscal year 2025–2026, despite the United States imposing a <strong>26% tariff</strong> on Indian imports.</p><p>Officials stated that the target remains achievable if <strong>oil prices stay below $70 per barrel</strong>, a key factor in India’s inflation and import bill.</p><p>However, several economists expressed skepticism. <strong>Private sector forecasts have already been revised down</strong> by 20 to 40 basis points in response to the new tariff regime.</p><p>Sectors like <strong>diamond exports</strong>, which are highly dependent on the U.S. market, are likely to suffer the most.
